Project Description:

TaskMaster Pro is a comprehensive task management system designed to streamline team collaboration and enhance productivity. This project enables users to efficiently manage their tasks with various features aimed at simplifying task creation, assignment, editing, status tracking, and organization.

Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can create tasks with essential details, including the date of creation, entity name (customer), task type, and the time when the task is to be done. Optionally, users can add notes associated with the task.

Task Assignment: Tasks can be assigned to team members, referred to as the contact person, ensuring clarity on who is responsible for completing each task.

Task Editing: Users have the ability to edit existing tasks, allowing for updates and modifications as needed.

Status Management: Tasks can have a status of either open or closed, with the default status set to open upon creation. Users can change the status of tasks to reflect their current state.

Sorting and Filtering: To enhance task organization, users can sort and filter tasks by team members, task type, status, date, entity name, and contact person. This feature helps users quickly locate and manage specific tasks based on various criteria.

Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed, keeping the task list relevant and up-to-date.

TaskMaster Pro is designed to improve task management efficiency, making it easier for teams to collaborate, track progress, and achieve their goals.
